  The gut microbiota is closely associated with the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) in which <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> (<i>F. nucleatum</i>) was found to induce cancer resistance to chemotherapeutics. To relieve <i>F. nucleatum</i> induced drug resistance, herein, we found that short-chain fatty acid butyrate can inhibit the growth, enrichment and adhesion of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in colorectal cancer tissues by downregulating the expression of adhesion-associated outer membrane proteins, including RadD, FomA, and FadA, to reduce the colonization and invasion of <i>F. nucleatum</i> and relieve the chemoresistance induced by <i>F. nucleatum</i>. Leveraging the killing effect of butyrate on <i>F. nucleatum</i>, sodium butyrate (NaBu) was encapsulated in liposomes or prepared as NaBu tablets with Eudragit S100 coating and administered by intravenous injection or oral administration, respectively. Interestingly, both intravenous administration of NaBu liposomes and oral delivery of NaBu tablets could effectively inhibit the proliferation of <i>F. nucleatum</i> and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of oxaliplatin in mice with subcutaneous colorectal tumors, orthotopic colorectal tumors and even spontaneously formed colorectal tumors. Thus, our work provides a simple but effective formulation of NaBu to relieve <i>F. nucleatum</i> induced chemoresistance, exhibiting ideal clinical application prospects.
