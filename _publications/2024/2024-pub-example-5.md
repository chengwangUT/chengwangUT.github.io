  <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> (<i>F. nucleatum</i>), an oral anaerobe, is prevalent in colorectal cancer and is closely related to increased cancer cell growth, metastasis, and poor treatment outcomes. Bacterial vaccines capable of selectively eliminating bacteria present a promising approach to targeting intratumor <i>F. nucleatum</i>, thereby enhancing cancer treatment. Although adjuvants have been employed to enhance the immune response, the vaccineâ€™s effectiveness is constrained by inadequate T-cell activation necessary for eradicating intracellular pathogens. In this study, we developed a minimalistic, biomimetic nanovaccine by integrating highly immunostimulatory adjuvant cholesterol-modified CpG oligonucleotides into the autologously derived <i>F. nucleatum</i> membranes. Compared to the traditional vaccines consisting of inactivated bacteria and Alum adjuvant, the nanovaccine coupled with bacterial membranes and adjuvants could remarkably improve multiple antigens and adjuvant co-delivery to dendritic cells, maximizing their ability to achieve effective antigen presentation and strong downstream immune progress. Notably, the nanovaccine exhibits outstanding selective prophylactic and therapeutic effects, eliminating <i>F. nucleatum</i> without affecting intratumoral and gut microbiota. It significantly enhances chemotherapy efficacy and reduces cancer metastasis in <i>F. nucleatum</i>-infected colorectal cancer. Overall, this work represents the rational application of bacterial nanovaccine and provides a blueprint for future development in enhancing the antitumor effect against bacterial-infected cancer.
