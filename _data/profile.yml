    Hi! My name is Cheng Wang (王成, pronounced as "Wahng Churn"). I am currently working as a product development specialist at a leading pharmaceutical company in China. Before that, I graduated from the <a href="https://funsom.suda.edu.cn/funsomen/main.htm">Institute of Functional Nano & Soft materials</a> (FUNSOM) at <a href="https://eng.suda.edu.cn/">Soochow University</a>, where I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://funsom.suda.edu.cn/7c/b0/c2735a294064/page.htm">Qian Chen</a>. My research focuses on biomedical nanomaterials and their applications in cancer therapy and biomedical engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been admitted to the Ph.D. program in <a href="https://bioeng.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/">Bioengineering</a> at <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html">The University of Tokyo</a> for Fall 2025 and have been nominated as a candidate for the <a href="https://www.mext.go.jp/en/index.htm">Japanese Government (Monbu-kagakusho)</a> Scholarship, providing me with a valuable window to further immerse myself in research.
